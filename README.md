<h1>Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>

Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game, built as part of my web development journey with The Odin Project!

This project is part of my learning experience with The Odin Project course, designed to showcase my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
